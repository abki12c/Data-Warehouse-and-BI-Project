# About
This is a project about creating a data warehouse, which is used to create visualizations on Power Bi and create Data Mining Models.

The tools used in this project are the following:
- Python
- SQL Server Management Studio 19
- SQL Server
- Visual Studio 2022
- Microsoft Analysis Services Projects extension (Visual Studio)
- SQL Integration Services Projects extension (Visual Studio)
- Power BI
- RapidMiner Studio

 You can check out the report of the project [here](report.pdf) and the PowerPoint presentation [here](Presentation.pptx). [BiReport](BiReport.pbix) is the Power Bi report file, [clean_data](clean_data.py) is the Python file used to clean the dataset and [queries_used](queries_used.sql) is an sql file containing the sql statements used throught the course of implementing this project. I also included the files for the Integration Services Project and the Multidimensional Project, as well as a backup file of the database [here](CarSales.bak).


## Project Instructions

You will use SQL Server (database and analysis services)

a) A large data set will be found, which should be cleaned and imported into a
data warehouse, which will be designed by the teams . You will
create a data cube and various metrics.

b) A visualization tool (Tableau or Power BI) will be used to create
various data visualization cases.

c) Data Warehouse data will be used for some mining operations
data, such as for example classification, association rules, clustering, etc.
using methods and models of a commercial system or an open-source tool.
You will implement at least two models.

To find the datasets, you can search the internet for relevant ones
websites (e.g. https://www.kaggle.com/, http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/,
